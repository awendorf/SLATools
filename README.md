These are scripts that I use to help me prepare class materials.

These scripts are not particularly user friendly, but I will try to keep them well commented.
Scripts will indicate what OS and language version they are developed on, as well as the command to use in the command line to run them, the files that are needed (and where they are needed), and any customization that can be made.
Please feel free to add comments, suggestions, etc.
