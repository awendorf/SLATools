#There should be a text file called TaggedCaptions.txt in the same folder with this script
#See the comments in "Cleaner.py" with instructions on how to prepare this file.
#You should adjust the content of this script as indicated below
#This script will go through the compilation of the srt files and locate each occurance
#of each grammar item and then create two new files.
#The first is called GrammarWorksheet.txt and contains extracts from the original texts
#Each extract is a blank space (where a vocabulary item should go), followed by a verb
#in the infinitive form, surrounded by some context. The second file is the answer key.

#This script was created in Windows 7 using Python 3.3.3
#To run, make sure TaggedCaptions.txt is prepared and in the same folder
#with this script, update the content of the script as desired
#open command prompt, navigate to folder that contains this script
#and use: python VerbFinder.py
#Currently this script only searches for verbs in particular conjugations
